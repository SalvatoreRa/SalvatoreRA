## About

I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at Oncodesign in Dijon. My work consists in investigating how new drugs affect gene expression in cancer. I am particularly interested in understanding how, through supervised and reinforcement learning, potential drugs can impact on patient prognosis.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Immunology at the Institute Marie Curie, Paris, where I became passionate about bioinformatics and its potential future applications. In the future I see myself going forwards along this path and I am planning to use AI in biology and pharmaceutical fields.

## Programming and Data skills

I am currently working on NLP, graph NN, neural networks focused on the exploitation of Multi-omics data with the aim of identifying new threapeutic target
